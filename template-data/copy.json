By far the most common methods are condoms and The Pill.","ever_used_chartT":"Types of Birth Control Used (Ever)","ever_used_chartS":"Based on Survey Results","firstTime-sub":"It feels like the first time...","firstTime-text":"Part of the reason that so many people have used condoms at some point, could have to do with their first experiences with contraception. Condoms are, and have been, the reigning champs of contraception for new-users.

Easily accessible condoms are used most often by younger users, whereas surgical options (for people with either internal or external reproductive organs) are more common in older users.

Unfortunately, some of the most recent research into a safe, effective method was halted by a safety committee early due to, you guessed it, <a href=https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/101/12/4779/2765061 target=_blank>side effects</a> (specifically acne, increased libido, injection site pain, and mood disorders).
