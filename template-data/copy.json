Having blatant conversations about contraception, including about making medical decisions for non-medical reasons, in a very open forum was a new and interesting experience for me. It made me wonder what we could learn if we surveyed more than our peer-group."},{"type":"text","value":"Luckily, between 2006 and 2015, the CDC has asked more than 20,000 people about their contraceptive experiences and here’s what they had to say."}],"ever_used_hed":"Condoms and The Pill are Go-To’s","ever_used_intro":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
